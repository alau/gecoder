= Gecode/R

Website: http://gecoder.org

Gecode/R is a Ruby interface to the Gecode constraint programming library. 
Gecode/R is intended for people with no previous experience of constraint 
programming, aiming to be easy to pick up and use.

See Gecode::Model to get started.

== Warning

Gecode/R is still in a development stage, the syntax is by no means final
and backwards compatibility will be broken time and time again. Don't use 
Gecode/R in production-code yet, it's merely available at this point to allow 
people to play with it and give feedback.

== Installation

Gecode/R requires Gecode 2.1.1, which can be downloaded from 
http://www.gecode.org/download.html . See 
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageComp.html for the installation
instructions.

=== Installing from gem

There are two gems. The first includes only Gecode/R, and assumes that you have
installed Gecode yourself. The second includes both Gecode/R and Gecode. If you 
use Windows then you're recommended to use the second one, even though you 
already have Gecode, as the other one does not come in a pre-compiled variant.

Gecode/R only:
  gem install gecoder
  
Gecode/R and Gecode:
  gem install gecoder-with-gecode

=== Installing from source using gem

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/gecoder-0.x.x.gem

=== Installing from source without using gem

"gecode.so" might have another extension depending on which platform it's 
generated on (replace the extension in the following commands with whatever 
extension it's given).

  cd ext
  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  mv gecode.so ../lib/

=== Running the tests

  rake specs

Requires RSpec (1.0.5, but other version should hopefully work).
