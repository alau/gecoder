h1. Downloading and installing

h2. Warning

Gecode/R is still in a development stage, the syntax is by no means final
and *backwards compatibility will be broken* time and time again. Don't use 
Gecode/R in production-code yet, it's merely available at this point to allow 
people to play with it and give feedback.

h2. Quick install

The following works on Windows, Linux and OS X (and probably some more).

  gem install gecoder-with-gecode

h3. Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error that is not listed here then please let us know via 
the "gecode-users mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/gecoder-users.

h5. Windows

  ERROR: error installing gem [...]: buffer error

The above error message means that you need to upgrade RubyGems (it works with
1.0.1). Run the following command.

  gem update --system

h5. Linux

  libgecodeset.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

If you get the above error message when requiring the Gecode/R gem then you 
need to add @/usr/local/lib@ (where the Gecode libraries are stored) to 
@ld.so.conf@ by doing the following as root.

  echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
  /sbin/ldconfig

h2. Detailed information

h3. Dependencies

Gecode/R requires Gecode 2.1.1. You can either manually install it or use the 
gem that includes Gecode.
* "Gecode download link":http://www.gecode.org/download.html
* "Gecode installation instructions":http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageComp.html

h3. RubyGems

Use the following gem if you don't have Gecode installed, or are using Windows. 
It includes both Gecode/R and Gecode 2.1.1.

 gem install gecoder-with-gecode 

Use the following gem if you want to install Gecode/R without Gecode.

 gem install gecoder
 
h3. Direct download

Downloads (both gems and source archives) are available at "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3553

h3. Building from source

There are two ways to get a hold of the source code.

* Download the source of a release from "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3553
* Check out the most recent code from subversion using <pre>svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/gecoder/trunk gecoder</pre>

The interface is installed as follows once the source is obtained. This is not
tested under Windows (where it will probably differ a bit).

# Enter the ext directory.
# Run @ruby extconf.rb@ 
# Run @make@ (builds the extension)
# Move the created library named @gecode.so@ to the lib directory.

h2. Running the tests

To make sure that the installation was successful you can run the included 
specs. They require "RSpec":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/download.html 1.0.5 or
something similar. Run the specs by issuing the following command from the 
directory where Gecode/R was installed.

  rake specs
