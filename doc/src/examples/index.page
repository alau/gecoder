h2. Overview

The following are the examples located in the example directory. 

* "send+more=money":send-more-money.html - The "Hello world" of constraint programming. Shows the basic usage with some linear and distinct constraints.
* "send+most=money":send-most-money.html - Similar to the above, but also shows an example of optimization search.
* "Sudoku":sudoku.html - The popular puzzle solved using constraint programming. Shows how to use matrices and set propagation strengths.
* "Sudoku with sets":sudoku-set.html - The sudoku puzzle again, but this time using sets and a different viewpoint. Shows how to use set operations.
* "N-queens":n-queens.html - Shows how to use distinct with offsets.
* "Magic sequence":magic-sequence.html - Uses the count constraint and some implied constraints.

Note that

<ruby>require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/example_helper'</ruby>

should be replaced with 

<ruby>
require 'rubygems'
require 'gecoder'
</ruby>

when running them from another location.
