h1. Downloading and Installing

h2. Quick Install

The following works on Windows, Linux and OS X (and probably some more).

  gem install gecoder-with-gecode

h3. Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error that is not listed here then please let us know via
the "issue tracker":https://github.com/alau/gecoder/issues.

h5. Windows

  ERROR: error installing gem [...]: buffer error

The above error message means that you need to upgrade RubyGems (it works with
1.2.0). Run the following command.

  gem update --system

h5. Linux

  libgecodeset.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

If you get the above error message when requiring the Gecode/R gem then you
need to add @/usr/local/lib@ (where the Gecode libraries are stored) to
@ld.so.conf@ by doing the following as root.

  echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
  /sbin/ldconfig

h2. Detailed Information

h3. Dependencies

Gecode/R requires Gecode 2.2.0. You can either manually install it or use the
gem that includes Gecode.

* "Gecode download link":http://www.gecode.org/download.html
* "Gecode installation instructions":http://www.gecode.org/doc/2.2.0/reference/PageComp.html

h3. RubyGems

Use the following gem if you don't have Gecode installed, or are using Windows.
It includes both Gecode/R and Gecode 2.2.0.

 gem install gecoder-with-gecode

Use the following gem if you want to install Gecode/R without Gecode.

 gem install gecoder

h3. Direct Download

Gems are available from "RubyGems":https://rubygems.org/gems/gecoder . Source archives are available from "GitHub":https://github.com/alau/gecoder/releases .

h3. Building from Source

There are two ways to get a hold of the source code.

* Download the source of a release from "GitHub":https://github.com/alau/gecoder/releases
* Clone the repository from GitHub using <pre>git clone https://github.com/alau/gecoder.git</pre>

The interface is installed as follows once the source is obtained. This is not
tested under Windows (where it will probably differ a bit).

# Enter the ext directory.
# Run @ruby extconf.rb@
# Run @make@ (builds the extension)
# Move the created library named @gecode.so@ to the lib directory.

h2. Running the Tests

To make sure that the installation was successful you can run the included
specs. Install the dependencies using "Bundler":http://bundler.io and then run
the specs by issuing the following command from the directory where Gecode/R
was installed.

  rake specs
