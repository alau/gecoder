h1. Downloading and installing

h2. Warning

Gecode/R is still in a development stage, the syntax is by no means final
and *backwards compatibility will be broken* time and time again. Don't use 
Gecode/R in production-code yet, it's merely available at this point to allow 
people to play with it and give feedback.

h2. Dependencies

Gecode/R requires Gecode 1.3.1. You can either manually install it or use the 
gem that includes Gecode.
* "Gecode download link":http://www.gecode.org/download.html
* "Gecode installation instructions":http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageComp.html

h2. Installation

h3. RubyGems

If you already have Gecode installed then just use the following.

 gem install gecoder

If you don't already have Gecode installed then you might find it convenient to 
install the following gem, which includes both Gecode/R and Gecode 1.3.1.

 gem install gecoder-with-gecode 

h4. Troubleshooting gem installation

If you encounter an error that is not listed here then please let us know via 
the "gecode-users mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/gecoder-users.

h5. Windows

You currently need a compiler installed to be able to install either gem (both 
are source only). Precompiled binaries will hopefully be available soon.

h5. Linux

  libgecodeset.so.8: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

If you get the above error message when requiring the Gecode/R gem then you 
need to add @/usr/local/lib@ (where the Gecode libraries are stored) to 
@ld.so.conf@ by doing the following.

  echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
  /sbin/ldconfig
 
h3. Direct download

Downloads (both gems and source archives) are available at "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3553

h3. Building from source

There are two ways to get a hold of the source code.

# Download the source of a release from "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3553
# Check out the most recent code from subversion using <pre>svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/gecoder/trunk gecoder</pre>
  
h4. Using gem

Build and install the gem from source with

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/gecoder-0.x.x.gem

h4. Without using gem

"gecode.so" might have another extension depending on which platform it's 
generated on (replace the extension in the following commands with whatever 
extension it's given).

  cd ext
  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  mv gecode.so ../lib/

h2. Running the tests

To make sure that the installation was successful you can run the included 
specs. They require "RSpec":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/download.html 1.0.5 or
something similar. Run the specs by issuing the following command from the 
directory where Gecode/R was installed.

  rake specs
