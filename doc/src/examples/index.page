h1. Examples

The following are the examples located in the example directory. 

<dl>
  <dt>"send+more=money":send-more-money.html</dt><dd>The "Hello world" of constraint programming. Shows the basic usage with some linear and distinct constraints.</dd>
  <dt>"send+most=money":send-most-money.html</dt><dd>Similar to the above, but also shows an example of optimization search.</dd>
  <dt>"Sudoku":sudoku.html</dt><dd>The popular puzzle solved using constraint programming. Shows how to use matrices and set propagation strengths.</dd>
  <dt>"Sudoku with sets":sudoku-set.html</dt><dd>The sudoku puzzle again, but this time using sets and a different viewpoint. Shows how to use set operations.</dd>
  <dt>"N-queens":n-queens.html</dt><dd>Shows how to use distinct with offsets.</dd>
  <dt>"Magic sequence":magic-sequence.html</dt><dd>Uses the count constraint and some implied constraints.</dd>
  <dt>"Nonograms - a.k.a. Paint by Numbers":nonogram.html</dt><dd>Uses regular
expression constraints to solve the popular logic puzzle.</dd>
  <dt>"Square tiling":square-tiling.html</dt><dd>Uses symmetry breaking and implied constraints to speed up the search.</dd>
  <dt>"Minesweeper":minesweeper.html</dt><dd>Minesweeper solved using constraint programming.</dd>
  <dt>"Survo puzzle":survo.html</dt><dd>The Survo puzzle solved using constraint programming.</dd>

Additionally, the following websites may be of interest:

  <dt>"hakank's Constraint Programming Blog":http://www.hakank.org/constraint_programming_blog/gecoder/<dt><dd>A blog containing "several example models":http://www.hakank.org/gecode_r/ along with the author's accounts of Gecode/R.</dd>
  <dt>"Gecode's example models":http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/group__ExProblem.html</dt><dd>Gecode/R is a Ruby interface to Gecode. Hence Gecode's example models can typically be translated constraint by constraint into Ruby.</dd>
