The problem is to, given the above equation, assign digits to each letter so 
that the equation holds when the letter are substituted with the assigned 
digits. No two letter may be assigned the same digit and the first letter of a 
word is not allowed to be assigned 0 (i.e. a number may not start with 0 in the 
equation).

{includeFile: {filename: ../../../example/send_more_money.rb, escapeHTML: false, processOutput: false, highlight: ruby}}

h3. Output

 s: 9, e: 5, n: 6, d: 7, m: 1, o: 0, r: 8, y: 2
