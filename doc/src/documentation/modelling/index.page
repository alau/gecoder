h1. Modelling a Problem

<div class="summary"> <p>Modelling can be broken down into several
steps. The first steps aim to express the problem so that one can get a
solution. The rest of the steps aim to look for ways to improve the
pruning so that one can get a solution quicker.</p> </div>

The following points are duplicated in the modelling examples found in
the menu. It might be helpful to read an example in parallel with this
page to get some concrete examples of each step.

h2. Understand the Problem

The first step is to understand the problem, more specifically to understand 
what is required of a solution to the problem. Express the entire problem in 
a few concise bullet points that describe exactly what is expected of a
solution.

h2. Select the View

The next step is to select how to represent the problem in terms of variables. 
The variables will need to include the sought solutions.

h3. Be Economic

Try to pick a view that cuts down on the number of constraints that 
explicitly have to be expressed.

An example is the {example: {name: n-queens, linkText: n-queens problem}} 
where the choice of view takes care of the constraint that
there may only be one queen per column. Using for instance an n-times-n matrix
of boolean variables would have required explicitly expressing that
constraint.

h3. Be Aware of Multiple Views

There may very well be multiple views that are equally good at representing 
the problem. Being aware of more than one might help further down the line. 
Constraints might end up being hard to describe in one view, but trivial in 
another.

There's no need to restrict oneself to only using one view. One can link
multiple views using the channel constraints to get the best of both
worlds.

h2. Express the Constraints

Now apply your understanding of the problem. Take a look at the points
and try to convert them into constraints (possibly multiple).  Multiple
views can help here since it might be easier to find corresponding
constraints when looking at a different view of the problem.

Remember that reification can be used to combine constraints and thereby express
complex rules. Reification should be thought of as a last resort as a single
constraint will probably be more powerful than if you glue several constraints 
together with reification.

h2. Select Branching Strategy

The last thing to think about is the branching. Anything that you tell Gecode
to branch on will be required to be assigned in a solution. Do not branch on 
variables that you do not need the values of from a solution.

Selecting branching strategy is mostly a question about coming up with a
heuristic that fits the problem. This can either be done by reasoning
about how the possibilities should best be explored or by simply testing
all the strategies to find out which work and which don't.

h2. Tweak the Performance

By now you should be able to feed the solver a simple problem and get pack a
correct solution. If it works fast enough for you then that's great, if not then
you need to tweak the performance.

h3. Select a Better Branching Strategy

Branching strategies can make a large difference. Which strategy is best
depends on the problem. Compare the available ones if you haven't
already done so.

h3. Change Propagation Strengths

Using different propagation strength can, much like branching strategies, make 
a large difference. Much like branching strategies it's a matter of reasoning 
or simply trying them out.

h3. Add Implied Constraints

Just because you have given the solver enough constraints to be able to identify
a solution doesn't mean that you have to stop there. It might still be worth 
explicitly expressing some of the constraints that are implicitly given by the 
expressed constraints. It will not change the solutions, but it can help Gecode 
prune the search space faster.

h3. Break Symmetries

In many situations symmetries will appear. 

In the {example: {name: n-queens, linkText: n-queens example}} there are several 
rotational and reflection symmetries. The chessboard can for instance be rotated 
without changing whether an assignment is a solution. Nothing is done to counter 
the symmetries in the example. There are in total only 12 unique solutions, but 
the example will return 92.

Symmetries are unnecessary since they add nothing. Removing them
means that you get a smaller search space, which means that you can find a 
solution faster. 

The way to remove symmetries is to impose additional constraints that do
not remove any unique solutions, only symmetries. In the n-queens case
you can for instance constrain the queen in the first column to be above
the queen in the last column. Any solution that the additional
constraint invalidates can be turned into a valid solution through
reflection in the y-axis of the board. Hence only removing symmetries,
not unique solutions.
