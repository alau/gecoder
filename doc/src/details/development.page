h1. Development

h2. Design Goals

Gecode/R is designed to be readable and to be easy to learn and use
without previous knowledge of constraint programming. Sometimes that
comes at the cost of brevity, performance and user control. The ambition
is that code using the interface should be readable enough to allow a
new user to understand it without having to look in the API
documentation.

The interface is currently aimed as a modelling interface. It does not
support e.g. defining new propagators.

h2. Development Status

The project is stable with a 1.0 release. 

h2. Future Goals

* Implement some of the missing variants of already implemented
  constraints (e.g. div and mod).
* Consider adding support for defining custom propagators and branching
  selection. This should primarily be aimed at rapid prototyping since the
  performance will be much worse than if the e.g. propagator was
  implemented in C++.
* Keep in sync with Gecode (prepare for Gecode 3.0).
