h1. Gecode/R

<div class="summary">
<p>Gecode/R is a Ruby interface to "Gecode":http://www.gecode.org/, a library for
constraint programming. The interface is intended for people with no previous 
experience of constraint programming, aiming to be easy to pick up and use in 
practice.</p>

h2. Constraint programming

Constraint programming is a declarative programming paradigm, you describe what 
kind of solution you want rather than how you want it computed. When using 
constraint programming you model the problem and then feed that model to the 
solver. The solver then searches for a solution by exploring the space of all 
possible assignments while using the constraints in the model to prune parts 
without having to visit them.

A popular example is sudoku, to {example: {name: sudoku, 
linkText: solve a sudoku with constraint programming}}  you feed the rules (all 
numbers in each row must be distinct etc) to the solver, which then searches 
for a solution satisfying all the constraints.
