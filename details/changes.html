    <h1>Changes</h1>


 
  
  <h2>Version 1.1.1</h2>
<p>
This release fixes a compilation error with newer versions of GCC.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a compilation error when installing gecoder-with-gecode using GCC
4.7+ .

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 1.1.0</h2>
<p>
This release fixes a compilation error when installing the
gecoder-with-gecode gem using GCC 4.4+ .
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added the :time_limit to Gecode#solve! which can be used to limit the
amount of time that the solver is allowed to search for a solution.

</li>
<li>[#29630] Fixed compilation errors when installing gecoder-with-gecode using
GCC 4.4+ .

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 1.0.0</h2>
<p>
This release represents a commitment to the current syntax.
</p>
<ul>
<li>No changes apart from improving documentation.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.9.1</h2>
<p>
This release changes the preferred way of defining a model to including
Gecode::Mixin (a mixin) rather than inheriting from Gecode::Model. The
backend has also been updated to fix some rare bugs.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Gecode::Mixin which can be mixed in rather than inheriting from
Gecode::Model. Thanks to Adam Rose for the suggestion.

</li>
<li>Updated the backend to Gecode 2.2.0. See
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageChanges_2_2_0.html for a list
of changes.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.9.0</h2>
<p>
This release adds a generous amount of sugar designed to cut down on often
repeated code. It also adds the ability to freely combine constraints
without needing temporary variables.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables that should be accessible from outside the model can now easily
be created by calling &quot;&lt;variable_name&gt;_is_a
&lt;variable&gt;&quot; where &quot;&lt;variable_name&gt;&quot; is the
desired name of the variable and &quot;&lt;variable&gt;&quot; is the
variable (e.g. &quot;int_var(17)&quot;). Take a look at the examples to see
it in action.

</li>
<li>Gecode.solve, Gecode.maximize and Gecode.minimize can now be used to solve
a problem without first having to explicitly create a class for the model.

</li>
<li>An exception (Gecode::NoSolutionError) is now thrown if a solution can not
be found when using Model#solve!, Model#minimize!, Model#maximize! and
Model#optimize! (rather than returning nil). This change breaks backwards
compatibility. If you feel that this is a bad change then please tell the
mailing list.

</li>
<li>The offset option to the distinct constraint is now given as
&quot;int_enum.must_be.distinct(:offset =&gt; offsets)&quot; rather than
the previous &quot;int_enum.with_offsets(offsets).must_be.distinct&quot;.

</li>
<li>Complex combinations of several constraints such as &quot;(set1.size +
set2.size).must &gt; int.abs - 3&quot; can now be used. The underlying code
has been changed quite a bit, but it should remain backwards compatible
except for above mentioned exception. The change also brings about some
changed terminology, which mostly aims to remove the concept of
&quot;composite constraints&quot; and replace them with the more general
&quot;operands&quot; (see the documentation for further details).

</li>
<li>[#21578] Fixed a bug that caused options given to the boolean
&quot;false&quot; domain constraint to not be processed.

</li>
<li>[#21579] Fixed a bug that caused the integer enumeration equality
constraint to not work at all (threw an exception).

</li>
<li>[#21580] Fixed a bug that caused ranges that use three dots to not be
correctly interpreted by the negated integer domain constraint.

</li>
<li>[#21581] Fixed a bug that caused the abs constraint to prune away valid
solutions in some cases.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.8.3</h2>
<p>
This release adds regular expression constraints, the last channel
constraint and various minor convenience improvements. It also fixes a
rather serious bug that occurs when using the latest patchlevels of Ruby
1.8.6.
</p>
<ul>
<li>[#20888] Fixed a GC bug causing problems with Ruby 1.8.6 at patchlevels
around 230.

</li>
<li>Boolean constraints can no longer be specified using the form
&quot;bool.must == true&quot;. Only the &quot;bool.must_be.true&quot; form
can now be used.

</li>
<li>Added constants in Model that contain the limits of the variables&#8217;
domains.

</li>
<li>The domain when construction arrays and matrices of int variables now
default to the same as when creating single variables (the largest possible
domain).

</li>
<li>Model#branch_on now accepts single variables as well as enums.

</li>
<li>Added channel constraints between single set variables and enumerations of
boolean variables.

</li>
<li>Added integer and boolean regular expression constraints. Thanks goes to
Eivind Eklund for providing the idea for the syntax used to specify the
regular expressions.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.8.2</h2>
<p>
This release adds search statistics along with some new arithmetic
constraints and channel constraints between boolean and integer variables.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrapping an enumerable that is already wrapped is no longer allowed.

</li>
<li>Added search statistics.

</li>
<li>Added squared value and square root constraints.

</li>
<li>Added channel constraints between single integer variables and boolean
variables.

</li>
<li>Added channel constraints between enumerations of boolean variables and
single integer variables.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.8.1</h2>
<p>
This release adds tuple constraints along with a couple of minor features.
It also fixes a bug introduced in the previous version.
</p>
<ul>
<li>[#19435] Fixed a bug causing inconsistencies during BAB-search. The bug
stopped the send+more=money example from working correctly.

</li>
<li>Fixed the &quot;raw_bindings&quot; and &quot;sudoku-set&quot; examples,
which were broken by the 0.8.0 release.

</li>
<li>Integers can now be used to specify singleton lower and upper bounds when
creating set variables.

</li>
<li>Added convenience methods Model#maximize! and Model#minimize! for
optimizing single variables.

</li>
<li>Added tuple constraints for enumerations of integer and boolean variables.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.8.0</h2>
<p>
This release makes the jump from using Gecode 1.3.1 to using Gecode 2.1.1 .
The following changes have been made to the interface as a result of the
jump.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed the distinct constraint for sets.

</li>
<li>Added the propagation kind option to the non-set constraints.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.7.1</h2>
<p>
This release adds boolean linear constraints.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Set domain constraints now checks illegal parameters when it&#8217;s added
(rather than when the search begins).

</li>
<li>Added boolean linear constraint.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.7.0</h2>
<p>
This release adds the set selection and operation constraints.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added set selection constraints (set array access, select union, select
intersection (optionally with specified universe) and select disjoint).

</li>
<li>Added set operation constraints (union, minus, disjoint_union and
intersection) on pairs of set variables or set constants with variable or
constant right hand side.

</li>
<li>Added set operation constraints on enumerations of sets.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.6.1</h2>
<p>
This release fixes various bugs introduced in 0.6.0 and changes the way
that int variable domains are specified (breaking backward-compatibility).
</p>
<ul>
<li>The domain for int variables can no longer be specified as several
individual elements, it has to be specified as either a single element, a
range or another enumeration.

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with set cardinality, min and max constraints using composite
sugar.

</li>
<li>Variables can now be created inside the optimization block.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.6.0</h2>
<p>
This release adds most of the remaining set constraints. It also makes
backward-compatibility breaking changes to the way that properties of
variables are accessed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added channel constraints involving set variables.

</li>
<li>Added set min and max constraints.

</li>
<li>Added set sum constraints (optionally weighted or substituted).

</li>
<li>Added include (match) constraint for sets.

</li>
<li>Added distinct constraints (distinct and at most one) for sets.

</li>
<li>Added branch and bound search (optimization search). It&#8217;s quite shaky
at the moment though.

</li>
<li>Assigned values of variables are now always accessed using #value instead
of the various previous methods. The methods for extracting information
from set variables have been changed and renamed.

</li>
<li>Enumerations containing variables now provide a convenience method #values
which returns an array of the enum&#8217;s values.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.5.0</h2>
<p>
This release adds set variables and some of their constraints, along with
the last of the boolean constraints.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added exclusive or and implication.

</li>
<li>Added conjunction and disjunction for boolean enumerations.

</li>
<li>Added set variables. They are created using Model{#set_var, #set_var_array,
#set_var_matrix}.

</li>
<li>Added domain constraints for set variables.

</li>
<li>Added relation constraints for set variables.

</li>
<li>Added set cardinality constraints.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.4.0</h2>
<p>
This release adds most of the integer variable constraints supported by
Gecode.
</p>
<ul>

domains.

</li>
<li>Added domain constraints for int variables.

</li>

<li>Added arithmetic constraints (min, max, abs and variable multiplication).

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Version 0.3.0</h2>
<p>
This release fleshes out the existing constraints with things such as
reification and adds boolean variables and their basic constraints.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The constructor of Gecode::Model no longer has to be called by classes
inheriting from it.

</li>
<li>Added Model#reset! which resets a model after search.

</li>
<li>Added Model#solution which passes the first solution to a block and returns
the result of that block.

</li>
<li>Added Model#each_solution which iterates over each solution.

</li>
<li>Added boolean variables. They are created using Model#bool_var and
Model#bool_var_array .

</li>
<li>Added two options to constraints: propagation strength and reification
variable.

#equal, #equal_to, #greater, #greater_than,&#8230; in addition to
comparison operators.
