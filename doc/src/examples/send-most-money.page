h1. send+most=money

h2. Problem

<pre>
   send
 + most
 ------
  money
</pre>

Given the above equation, assign digits to each letter so that the equation 
holds when the letter are substituted with the assigned digits. No two letter 
may be assigned the same digit and the first letter of a word is not allowed to 
be assigned 0 (i.e. a number may not start with 0 in the equation). There are 
multiple valid assignments, the one which maximizes the value of "money" is 
sought.

h2. Code

{exampleScript: send_most_money.rb}

h2. Output

 s e n d m o s t y
 3 7 8 2 1 0 9 4 6
 money: 10876
