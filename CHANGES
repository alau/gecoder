== Version 0.3.1 (in SVN)

* [#11861] Fixed a bug stopping the creating of int variables with non-range domains.
* Added domain constraints for int variables.
* Added equality constraint for int enums.
* Matrices of integer and boolean variables can now be created using Model#int_var_matrix Model#bool_var_matrix.
* Added channel constraint for int enums.
* Added element constraints (variable array access).

== Version 0.3.0

* The constructor of Gecode::Model no longer has to be called by classes inheriting from it.
* Added Model#reset! which resets a model after search.
* Added Model#solution which passes the first solution to a block and returns the result of that block.
* Added Model#each_solution which iterates over each solution.
* Added boolean variables. They are created using Model#bool_var and Model#bool_var_array .
* Added two options to constraints: propagation strength and reification variable.
* Linear and simple relation constraints can now also be specified using #equal, #equal_to, #greater, #greater_than,... in addition to comparison operators.
* Added distinct with offsets.
* Simple relation constraints can now be used to specify relations between two variables.
* Added basic boolean domain constraints along with conjunction and disjunction.
* Added syntactic sugar for combining reifiable constraints with | and &.

== Version 0.2.0

This is the first release of Gecode/R, a Ruby interface to Gecode.

* Added support for finite domain integers.
* Added some basic relation, linear and distinct constraints.
* Added the basis needed to model problems and find the first solution.
