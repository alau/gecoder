h2. Constraints

There exist several different constraints that can be used when modelling. They
are usually used with some form of call to the methods @must@ or @must_not@ of
variables.

h3. Simple relations

Simple relation constraints can for instance specify that x must be strictly 
greater than 3, where x is an integer variable. An example of how to write that 
would be the following.

 x.must > 3

Only constant integers can be used in the right hand side at the moment. The
following relations are supported:

* <
* >
* >=
* <=
* <no_textile>==</not_textile>

Each can be negated by using @must_not@ instead of @must@. For instance to 
express that x must not be 0 we can use the following.

 x.must_not <no_textile>==</not_textile> 0

h3. Linear

Linear constraints can be used to specify that a linear equation containing
variables must hold. It's specified in similar way to simple relation 
constraints. The following expresses that x + y must be equal to z + 3 where
x,y,z are all integer variables.

 (x + y).must <no_textile>==</not_textile> z + 3

The constraint supports the same relations as simple relation constraints 
inlcuding negating relations using @must_not@.

h3. Distinct

The distinct constraint is used on enumerations of integer variables an 
specifies that they must all be distinct. The following will for instance
create an array of 8 integer variables with domains 0..9 and constrain them
all to be distinct (i.e. no two integer variables in the array may take the 
same value in solution).

 numbers = int_var_array(8, 0..9)
 numbers.must_be.distinct

@must_be@ can also be replaced with @must@. The constraint does not support 
negation.

h2. Options

Constraints can in general take a couple of options: *proagation strength* and
*reficiation*.

h3. Propagation strength

The propagation strength basically _suggests_ how much effort the solver puts 
into trying to prune the domains of variables using the constraint. A higher 
strength can reduce the search space quicker, but at a cost of making each 
propagation more costly (hence it's a balance).

It's usually worth testing a few different strength to see how well they work, 
a good choice of strengths can cut down the search time depending on the 
problem.

The different strengths are:
* @:value@ - value consistency (naive).
* @:domain@ - domain consistency, every element in the domain satisfies the constraint.
* @:bounds@ - bounds consistency, the boundaries of the domain satisfy the constraint.
* @:default@ - uses the default consistency for the constraint.

They are specified with the key @:strength@. The following places a domain 
consistent distinct constraint on @numbers@.

 numbers.must_be.distinct(:strength => :distinct)

h3. Reification
 
Reification is used to link a constraint to a boolean variable in such a way
that the variable is true if and only if the constraint is satisfied. The 
propagation goes both ways, so if the variable is constrained to be false then
the constraint is not allowed to be satisfied.

Reification can be thought of as a last resort glue which can be used to combine
constraints so that e.g. exactly 3 out of 17 constraints must be satisfied.

The variable to use for reification is specified with the key @:reify@. The
following connects the boolean variable @is_large@ with a relation constraint.

 number.must_be.greater_than(17, :reify => is_large)

This constraint does not force @number@ to be greater than 17 (which would be 
the case if no reification has been used).
