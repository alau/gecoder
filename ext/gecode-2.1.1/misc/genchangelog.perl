$versions
 - \\ref PageChanges_1_0_0 "Gecode 1.0.0 (2005-12-06)"

\\section SectionChangeWhat Gecode Version Numbers

%Gecode version numbers <em>x</em>.<em>y</em>.<em>z</em> change
according to the following rules (of thumb):

 - when \\e z changes, the programming interfaces for 
   \\ref TaskModel, and \\ref TaskSearch remain
   stable and only minor additions or improvements are included.
 - when \\e y changes, the above mentioned interfaces might have changed
   and medium to major additions or improvements are included.
 - the change of \\e x is reserved for radical changes to %Gecode.
