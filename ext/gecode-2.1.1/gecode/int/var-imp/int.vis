## General settings
##
## Defines the name (Name), the variable type identifier (uppercase Name),
## and the namespace (Namespace) of the variable implementation to be
## generated.
##
## Ifdef defines a macro that is define if the variable type
## is enabled.
##
## Dispose defines whether this variable type provides a dispose
## function that must be called for all variables in a space when the
## space is destroyed. If it is omitted, false is assumed.
##
## Bits defines the number of bits that should be reserved for use by the
## variable implementation. The number of bits reduces the number of
## propagators that can subscribe to the variable implementation.

## Definition of modification events
##
##
## ModEventHeader: give some text that precedes the definition
## of the modification events.
##
## ModEventFooter: give some text that comes after the definition
## of the modification events.
##
## ModEvent: defines a modification event
## The definition must always contain a Name line, either in the form
##	Name: <name>
## or
##	Name: <name> = <special>
## where <special> must be one of
##  - FAILED: this is the modification event used when an operation
##    resulted in failure.
##  - NONE: this is the modification event used when an operation
##    does nothing.
##  - ASSIGNED: when the operation assigned the variable.
##  - SUBSCRIBE: when a propagator subscribes to a variable, the
##    propagator will be processed with that event initially.
##
## Note that at least the special cases "FAILED", "NONE", and "ASSIGNED"
## must be present. In case there are more events defined, then also
## "SUBSCRIBE" must be present.
##
## Additionally, for all modfication events but the special cases
## "FAILED" and "NONE" one needs to define the combination of
## modification events by
##	Combine: <me1>=<me2>, ... (repeated)
## This means that the combination of the currently defined
## modification event together with <me1> results in <me2>.

## Definition of propagation conditions
##
##
## PropCondHeader: give some text that precedes the definition
## of the propagation conditions. One can rely on the fact that
## the definitions of the propgation conditions come immediately
## after the definitions of the modification events.
##
## PropCondFooter: give some text that comes after the definition
## of the propagation conditions.
##
## PropCond: defines a propagation condition
## The definition must always contain a Name line, either in the form
##	Name: <name>
## or
##	Name: <name> = <special>
## where <special> must be
##  - ASSIGNED: the condition corresponding to executing a
##    propagator when a variable becomes assigned.
##
## Note that this special case must be present!
##
## Additionally, for all propagation conditions one must define
## the modification events that trigger execution of a propagator
## with the defined propagation condition. This is done by:
##	ModEvents: <me>, ... (repeeated)
