/**
 * \page PageNotation Notational conventions
 *
 * Throughout this reference documentation we use some notational conventions
 * designed to keep the documentation concise yet understandable. Please
 * read the following carefully.
 *
 * \section NotationArray Array notation
 *
 * We allow ourselves to refer to the \f$i\f$-th element of an array \f$x\f$ 
 * by \f$x_i\f$. The size of an array \f$x\f$ (either provided by a member 
 * function \c %size() or clear from context) is denoted \f$|x|\f$.
 *
 * \section NotationHome The home space
 *
 * Many functions and member functions take an argument \a home of 
 * type \c Space*. The home space serves as manager to many
 * operations used by variables, views, propagators, spaces, and so
 * on. It provides
 * services such as failure management, propagation control, 
 * memory management, and so on. To keep the documentation concise
 * the home space is not documented for functions
 * and member functions.
 *
 * \section NotationShare Sharing in update and copy
 *
 * In member functions that either copy or update an object during
 * cloning, an argument \a share of type \c bool is available. This
 * Boolean value controls whether during cloning the data structure at
 * hand will be shared among the newly created cloned space and the original
 * or whether two independent copies are created. Some functions (such
 * as \c copy for spaces (Gecode::Space) or \c copy for propagators
 * (Gecode::Propagator) also feature this argument. Here it is used
 * to pass on the Boolean value to other datastructures used inside spaces
 * or propagators.
 *
 * The actual value the \a share argument has is defined by the search
 * engine: when a search engine uses the \a clone member function of
 * a space it decides whether sharing is to be used in the cloning of
 * the space or not. If the search engine is single-threaded, it will
 * use full sharing (\a share will be true). Only if the search engine
 * uses concurrency or parallelism with more than a single thread,
 * it will pass false as value. This means that by not sharing data structures
 * among spaces which are to be used in different threads, all parts of
 * %Gecode but the actual search engine do not need to provide concurrency
 * control.
 *
 * As examples for data structures which are sensitive to sharing, consider
 * Gecode::SharedArray, Gecode::IntSet, and Gecode::DFA.
 */

/**
  \page PageGlossary Brief glossary

This page gives brief explanations about some of the most
frequently occurring terms (currently limited to important
entities manifest in the implementation) used in the %Gecode
reference documentation.

\section GlossaryActor Actor

An actor is a branching (\ref GlossaryBranching), a propagator
(\ref GlossaryPropagator), or an advisor (\ref
GlossaryAdvisor). Actors provide common functionality such as
member functions for copying during cloning, memory allocation,
and so on. Actors are implemented by the class
Gecode::Actor. More on programming actors can be found in the
module \ref TaskActor.

\section GlossaryBranching Branching

A branching defines the shape of the search tree. Branchings are
also known as labelings or distributors, and a branching creates
a series of choice points. Branchings are implemented by the
class Gecode::Branching. A common abstraction for defining
branchings based on view and value selection is provided by the
class Gecode::ViewValBranching.

\section GlossaryBranchingDesc Branching description

A branching description speeds up recomputation by providing
batch recomputation. It is created by a branching (\ref
GlossaryBranching) and allows to replay the effect of that
branching without the need to first perform constraint
propagation. The base-class for branching descriptions is
Gecode::BranchingDesc. An example for a branching description
that works together with branchings based on view and value
selection is Gecode::PosValDesc.

\section GlossarySpace Computation space

A computation space (space for short) comprises all entities for
a constraint problem to be solved, including all actors (\ref
GlossaryActor) and variables (\ref GlossaryVariable). A space can
be seen as corresponding to a node in the search tree. It
organizes constraint propagation, the branching process,
exploration, and memory management. Spaces are implemented by the
class Gecode::Space. They provide functionality for \ref
TaskModelScript, \ref TaskSearch, and \ref FuncMemSpace.

\section GlossaryME Modification event

A modification event describes how a view (\ref GlossaryView) or
variable implementation (\ref GlossaryVarImp) is changed by an
update operation performed on the view or variable. Each variable
domain defines its own modification events (see \ref
TaskActorIntMEPC and \ref TaskActorSetMEPC). However modification
events that describe generic events such as failure, no
modification, or assignment to a single value are predefined (see
\ref TaskVarMEPC).

\section GlossaryPropCond Propagation condition

A propagation condition defines when a propagator requires to be
re-executed. Re-execution is controlled by the modification events
that occur on the variables the propagator depends on (see \ref
GlossaryPropagator). Propagation conditions and the relation
between propagation conditions and modification events depends on
the variable domain (see \ref TaskActorIntMEPC and \ref
TaskActorSetMEPC). However, the propagation conditions that
states re-execution when a variable becomes assigned is generic
(see \ref TaskVarMEPC).

\section GlossaryPropagator Propagator

A propagator implements a constraint (actually, a constraint can
be implemented by a collection of propagators). Execution by a
propagator is defined by its dependencies: the views (referring to
some variables) together with their propagation conditions. A
propagator is implemented by inheriting from the class
Gecode::Propagator. Common abstractions for propagators are also
available (see \ref TaskPropPat, \ref TaskPropRePat, and \ref
TaskPropSetPat).

\section GlossaryAdvisor Advisor

An advisor supports a single propagator. An advisor is executed
whenever the view it has subscribed to is modified. Execution of
an advisor amounts to executing the advise member function of the
advisor's propagator where the advisor and delta information
(\ref GlossaryDelta) are passed as arguments. An advisor is
implemented by inheriting from the class Gecode::Advisor.

\section GlossaryDelta Delta information

Delta information is implemented as an object which is a subclass
of Gecode::Delta. A Delta object describes how the domain of a
variable has been changed by an operation on the variable. Delta
objects are passed together with advisors to the advise member
function of a propagator.

\section GlossaryMED Modification event delta

A propagator maintains a delta of modification events for all
variable types. A modification event delta is available to the
propagate and cost member functions of a propagator and describes
the modification events that have occurred since the last execution of a
propagator.  A modification event delta is highly abstract: it
does not reveal for which variable a particular modification
event occurred, it only reveals that a certain modification event
has occurred for any variable of a given variable
type. Modification events for a particular variable type can be
extracted from a modification event delta through the respective
view or variable implementation (see for example \ref
TaskActorIntView or \ref TaskActorSetView).

\section GlossaryVariable Variable

A variable is used for modeling problems, be it for direct
modeling or for modeling through some interface. A variable
provides only those operations useful for modeling and excludes
in particular operations that can modify the variable domain
directly. A variable is implemented by a variable implementation
(see below).

\section GlossaryVarImp Variable implementation

A variable implementation is implemented by inheriting from
Gecode::Variable. It implements the variable domain and provides
operations to access and modify the domain. Examples of variable
implementations are Gecode::Int::IntVarImp and
Gecode::Set::SetVarImp.

\section GlossaryView View

A view offers essentially the same interface as a variable
implementation and allows both domain access and
modification. Typically, several views exist for the same
variable implementation to obtain several constraints from the
same propagator. Examples of views are \ref TaskActorIntView and
\ref TaskActorSetView.

/**
 * \page PageUsage Compiling and linking against Gecode
 *
 * \section SecUsageInclude Including header files
 *
 * Deciding which header files must be included when using %Gecode is
 * quite straightforward. There are the following header files for inclusion:
 *  - gecode/support.hh must always included (support.hh header is 
 *    included from kernel.hh)
 *  - gecode/kernel.hh must always be included (the header files below
 *    also always include kernel.hh).
 *  - gecode/search.hh must be included, if search engines are used 
 *    (see for example \ref TaskModelSearch).
 *  - gecode/int.hh must be included, if any integer functionality is used
 *    (see for example \ref TaskModelInt and \ref TaskActorInt).
 *  - gecode/set.hh must be included, if any finite set functionality is used
 *    (see for example \ref TaskModelSet and \ref TaskActorSet).
 *  - gecode/cpltset.hh must be included, if any complete finite set 
 *    functionality is used
 *    (see for example \ref TaskModelCpltSet and \ref TaskActorCpltSet).
 *  - gecode/minimodel.hh must be included, if direct modelling support
 *    is used (see for example \ref TaskModelMiniModel).
 *  - gecode/serialization.hh must be included, if support for serialization
 *    is used.
 *
 * Other functionality is available through a set of header files. For example
 * to access the implementation of particular propagators, a particular header
 * file must be included. The header file to be included is always mentioned
 * in the documentation of the class or function.
 *
 * \section SecUsageLink Linking libraries
 *
 * Setting the exact name for a library on a particular platform aside,
 * inclusion of header files basically coincides with against which
 * library must be linked. That is:
 *  - If gecode/support.hh is included, linking againg the support library is 
 *    required.
 *  - If gecode/kernel.hh is included, linking against the kernel library is
 *    required.
 *  - If gecode/search.hh is included, linking against the search library is
 *    required.
 *  - If gecode/int.hh is included, linking against the integer library is
 *    required.
 *  - If gecode/set.hh is included, linking against the set library is
 *    required.
 *  - If gecode/cpltset.hh is included, linking against the cpltset library is
 *    required.
 *  - If gecode/minimodel.hh is included, linking against the minimodel
 *    library is required.
 *  - If gecode/serialization.hh is included, linking against the 
 *    serialization library is required.
 *
 * The functionality in \ref FuncIter requires no
 * library for linking. Reusing integer or set propagators of course
 * require the integer or set library.
 *
 * If there is a difference between library and DLL (such as on Windows)
 * linking must be done against the appropriate library and the
 * corresponding DLL must be available for execution (such as in the
 * PATH environment variable).
 *
 * The libraries contain code that is executed at link time (for registering
 * part of the reflection functionality).  If you create static libraries,
 * this code will not be linked into your executable as it is not directly
 * referenced. You will have to tell your linker to include all symbols from 
 * the library (e.g. using -Wl,--whole-archive on Linux). Please refer to your
 * linker documentation.
 *
 * \section SecUsageLibraries Library names
 *
 * \subsection SULA Windows with Visual Studio
 *
 *  - Support library and DLL: GecodeSupport.lib and GecodeSupport.dll
 *  - Kernel library and DLL: GecodeKernel.lib and GecodeKernel.dll
 *  - Search library and DLL: GecodeSearch.lib and GecodeSearch.dll
 *  - Integer library and DLL: GecodeInt.lib and GecodeInt.dll
 *  - Set library and DLL: GecodeSet.lib and GecodeSet.dll
 *  - CpltSet library and DLL: GecodeCpltSet.lib and GecodeCpltSet.dll
 *  - Minimodel library and DLL: GecodeMiniModel.lib and GecodeMiniModel.dll
 *  - Serialization library and DLL: GecodeSerialization.lib and 
 *    GecodeSerialization.dll
 *
 * \subsection SULB Unix (Linux, MacOS X)
 *
 * Depending on whether %Gecode was compiled as a static or as a dynamic
 * library, different filename suffixes are used on different Unix platforms.
 * All library names follow the following scheme:
 *
 *  - Support library: libgecodesupport.&lt;EXT&gt;
 *  - Kernel library: libgecodekernel.&lt;EXT&gt;
 *  - Search library: libgecodesearch.&lt;EXT&gt;
 *  - Integer library: libgecodeint.&lt;EXT&gt;
 *  - Set library: libgecodeset.&lt;EXT&gt;
 *  - CpltSet library: libgecodecpltset.&lt;EXT&gt;
 *  - Minimodel library: libgecodeminimodel.&lt;EXT&gt;
 *  - Serialization library: libgecodeserialization.&lt;EXT&gt;
 *
 * where &lt;EXT&gt; depends on the library type and platform:
 *
 *  - libgecode[...].a for static libaries on all Unix flavors
 *  - libgecode[...].so for shared libraries on Linux
 *  - libgecode[...].dylib for shared libraries on MacOS X
 *
 * You can use for example
 * 
 * <code>gcc -L$GPREFIX/lib -lgecodekernel</code>
 *
 * to link the kernel library, if the libraries are found in
 * <code>$GPREFIX/lib</code>.

/**
 * \page PageComp Compiling and installing Gecode
 *
 * The %Gecode library, including examples and documentation, can be built
 * on all recent versions of Windows, Linux, and MacOS X. Porting to other
 * Unix flavors should be easy, if any change is necessary at all.
 *
 * \section Prerequisites
 *
 * In order to compile %Gecode, you need a standard Unix toolchain including
 * the following programs:
 *
 *  - a bash-compatible shell
 *  - GNU make
 *  - sed
 *  - cp
 *  - diff
 *  - tar
 *  - perl
 *
 * These are available in all standard installations of Linux. On MacOS X,
 * you need to install the Apple developer tools. For
 * Windows, we require the
 * <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin environment</a> that provides
 * all necessary tools.
 *
 * We currently support
 *   - the Microsoft Visual C++ compilers for Windows. The Microsoft
 *     Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition is available free of charge from
 *     <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/">the MSDN
 *     web pages</a>. 
 *   - the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) for Windows and Unix flavors such as
 *     Linux and MacOS X. The GNU gcc is open source software and available
 *     from <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">the GCC home page</a>. It is included
 *     in all Linux distributions and the Apple MacOS X developer tools.
 *     %Gecode requires at least version 3.4 of gcc. We recommend using version
 *     4.2 or higher. Very unfortunately, the parser used in versions of gcc
 *     before 3.4 is broken and hence cannot compile %Gecode.
 *
 * The Intel C++ compiler is currently not supported.
 *
 * \section CompConf Configuring the sources
 *
 * %Gecode uses GNU autoconf to acquire information about the system it is
 * compiled on. Typically, you need to run the <code>configure</code>
 * script in the toplevel directory.
 *
 * To setup %Gecode for your particular system, you may need to add one or
 * more of the following options to <code>configure</code>:
 *
 *  - When using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, add
 *    <code>CC=cl CXX=cl</code> to your
 *    invocation of <code>configure</code>
 *  - To install %Gecode somewhere else than the default
 *    <code>/usr/local</code>, use the <code>--prefix=[...]</code> switch
 *  - You can enable and disable the individual modules %Gecode consists of
 *    using <code>--enable-[MODULE]</code> and <code>--disable-[MODULE]</code>
 *
 * You can get a list of all supported configuration options by calling 
 * <code>configure</code> with the <code>--help</code> switch.
 *
 * \subsection CompConfExamples Example configurations
 *
 * To compile %Gecode on a <b>Windows machine using the Microsoft compiler</b>, use
 *
 * <code>./configure CC=cl CXX=cl</code>
 *
 * To compile only the %Gecode library <b>without examples</b> on a Unix machine, use
 *
 * <code>./configure --disable-examples</code>
 *
 * To compile on a <b>Unix machine</b> using a different than the default
 * <code>gcc</code> compiler, and install under <code>/opt/gecode</code>, use
 *
 * <code>./configure --prefix=/opt/gecode CC=gcc-4.0 CXX=g++-4.0</code>
 *
 * To compile a <b>debug build</b> on Unix, turning on all assertions and not
 * inlining anything, use
 *
 * <code>./configure --enable-debug</code>
 *
 * To compile on <b>Cygwin</b>, but linking against the <b>Windows libraries</b> instead
 * of the Cygwin libraries, use
 *
 * <code>./configure CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" CXX="g++ -mno-cygwin"</code>
 * Note that we only support building static libraries on Cygwin.
 *
 * To compile on a system using a different than the default compiler,
 * and a <code>/bin/sh</code> that is not bash compatible (e.g. a
 * <b>Solaris machine</b>), use
 *
 * <code>./configure --with-host-os=linux \ </code><br>
 * <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CC="gcc-4.0" CXX="g++-4.0" \ </code><br>
 * <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHELL="/bin/bash"</code><br>
 * <code>make SHELL="/bin/bash"</code>
 *
 * You can compile as <b>"universal binary" on a Mac OS
 * machine</b>. Configure with
 *
 * <code>./configure --with-architectures=i386,ppc</code>
 *
 * For building universal binaries on a PowerPC machine, you have to supply
 * the path to the universal SDK (which is the default on Intel based Macs):
 * 
 * <code>./configure --with-architectures=i386,ppc</code>
 * <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--with-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk</code>
 *
 * \subsection CompConfUsr Passing options for compilation
 *
 * Additional options for compilation can be passed to the compiler
 * from the make commandline via the variable <code>CXXUSR</code>. For
 * example, to pass to gcc the additional option "-mtune=i686" the following
 * can be used:
 *
 * <code>make CXXUSR="-mtune=i686"</code>
 *
 * \subsection CompConfSepDir Compiling in a separate directory
 *
 * The %Gecode library can be built in a separate directory. This is useful
 * if you do not want to clutter the source tree with all the object files
 * and libraries.
 *
 * Configuring %Gecode in a separate directory is easy. Assume that the
 * sources can be found in directory <code>$GSOURCEDIR</code>, change to
 * the directory where you want to compile %Gecode and call
 *
 * <code>$GSOURCEDIR/configure [options]</code>
 *
 * This will generate all necessary files in the new build directory.
 *
 * \section CompComp Compiling the sources
 *
 * After successful configuration, simply invoking
 *
 * <code>make</code>
 *
 * in the toplevel %Gecode directory will compile the whole library.
 *
 * \section CompExamples Running the examples
 *
 * After compiling the examples, they can be run directly from the command
 * line. For instance, try the %Golomb Rulers Problem:
 *
 * <code>./examples/golomb</code>
 *
 * or (when running Windows):
 *
 * <code>./examples/golomb.exe</code>
 * 
 * On some platforms, you may need to set environment variables like
 * <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> (Linux) or <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
 * (Mac OS) to the toplevel compile directory (where the dynamic libraries
 * are placed after compilation).
 *
 * For more information on example scripts see \ref Example.
 *
 * \section Installation Installation
 *
 * After a successful compilation, you can install the %Gecode library
 * and all header files necessary for compiling against it by invoking
 *
 * <code>make install</code>
 *
 * in the build directory.
 *
 * \section DepMngmt Dependency management
 *
 * The dependencies between source files are not handled automatically. If you
 * are using a Gecode version from our subversion repository or if you
 * modified any of the source files, you will have to call
 * <code>make depend</code> before compilation in order to determine the
 * source dependencies.
 *
 * Dependency management is only needed for recompiling Gecode after changing
 * something. In an unmodified version (or after a <code>make clean</code>)
 * all files are compiled anyway.
 *
 * \section UnsupPlatfrms Compiling for unsupported platforms
 *
 * If you want to try compiling Gecode on a platform that we do not
 * mention, you can override the platform tests during
 * <code>configure</code>. There are two options to specify the type of
 * platform:
 *
 *  - <code>--with-host-os=[linux|darwin|windows]</code>
 *  - <code>--with-compiler-vendor=[gnu|microsoft]</code>
 *
 * Using the first option, you can state that your platform should behave like
 * Linux, Darwin (which is actually BSD), or Windows. This affects mainly
 * the filenames and the tools used to generate shared and static libraries.
 *
 * The second option says
 * that your compiler can be used very much like the gnu compiler
 * <code>gcc</code>, or the Microsoft compiler <code>cl</code>.
 * Please let us know of any successfull attempt at
 * compiling Gecode on other platforms.
 *
 * \section MakeTargets Useful Makefile targets
 *
 * The main %Gecode Makefile supports the following useful targets:
 *
 *  - <code>all</code> compiles all parts of the library that were enabled
 *                     during <code>configure</code>, and the examples if
 *                     enabled
 *  - <code>install</code> installs library, headers and examples (if enabled)
 *                         into the <code>prefix</code> given at
 *                         <code>configure</code>
 *  - <code>clean</code> removes object files
 *  - <code>veryclean</code> removes object files, libraries, and all files 
 +                           generated during <code>make</code>
 *  - <code>distclean</code> removes object files, libraries, and all
 *                           generated files
 *  - <code>depend</code> generates dependencies between source files
 *  - <code>test</code> compiles the test suite
 *  - <code>doc</code> generates this reference documentation using doxygen
 *  - <code>installdoc</code> installs the documentation
 *  - <code>dist</code> creates a source distribution as a tgz archive, not 
 *    including the contributions found in the <code>contribs</code> directory
 *  - <code>distdir</code> creates a source distribution in a directory, not 
 *    including the contributions found in the <code>contribs</code> directory
 *  - <code>distdoc</code> creates tgz and zip archives of the documentation
 *  - <code>distzip</code> creates a binary distribution as a zip archive
 *  - <code>disttgz</code> creates a binary distribution as a tgz archive
 *
 * \section CompileGist Compilation with Gist
 *
 * The %Gecode Interactive Search Tool (Gist) is a graphical search engine for 
 * %Gecode, built on top of the
 * <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt GUI toolkit</a>.
 *
 * In order to compile %Gecode with Gist, you need an installation of the Qt 
 * library including the development header files.  The source code for Qt is 
 * <a href="http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource">available from 
 * Trolltech under the GPL license.</a>
 *
 * <b>
 * Please note that if you want to develop closed-source software with %Gecode
 * and Gist, you will need to get a commercial license for Qt from Trolltech!
 * </b>
 *
 * If you are developing on Windows using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, 
 * make sure to compile the Qt library with the same compiler (this is 
 * possible with Qt version 4.3.2, even if the download page does not say so).
 *
 * If the <code>qmake</code> tool is in your shell path, all you need to do to 
 * enable Gist is to configure %Gecode with the switch 
 * <code>--enable-gist</code>.

/**
 * \page PageHowToChange_2 How to Change from Gecode 1.3.1 to Gecode 2.0.x
 *

As Gecode 2.0.0 is a major revision of Gecode, your programs that are written
for Gecode 1.3.1 are likely to require some modifications before they work
again. All modifications are straightforward, though.

This short summary shows how to adapt your models and linker invocation, for
changes to propagator implementations, etc, please consult the changelog.

\section SecChange2IntBool IntVar and BoolVar

Boolean variables (BoolVar) are not any longer integer variables
(IntVar). The same holds for variable arrays (BoolVarArray,
IntVarArray). So, you can not mix Boolean and integer variables
in the same array (use two different arrays) and you can not cast
between them. If you want to link the value of a BoolVar to the
value of an IntVar you have to use a \ref TaskModelIntChannel
"channel constraint".  Posting constraints remains unchanged, as
all constraints offer two overloaded versions (one for IntVar,
one for BoolVar).

\section SecChange2Regular Regular constraint

The regular constraint has been renamed to extensional (after
all, it is an extensionally specified constraint). The old name
is still available in the MiniModel module. 

If you want to use regular expressions, you have to add
   \code #include "gecode/int/minimodel.hh" \endcode
to your file as they moved to the MiniModel module.

\section SecChange2Bool Boolean constraints

In order to make the interface to Boolean constraints more
regular and similar to set constraints, Boolean constraints are
available as rel constraints. That is, instead of
   \code bool_and(home, x, y, z); \endcode
you have to write
   \code rel(home, x, BOT_AND, y, z); \endcode
Likewise, for arrays you have to write
   \code rel(home, BOT_AND, x, y); \endcode
instead of
   \code bool_and(home, x, y); \endcode
More information is available \ref TaskModelIntRelBool "here".

\section SecChange2Branching Branching

Values and types for selecting how to branch have been made uniform. 
Replace BVAL_* by INT_VAL_*, BVAR_* by INT_VAR_*, and so on.

\section SecChange2GCC Global cardinality constraint

The interface for the global cardinality constraint has been
simplified.  The constraint is now called count. Please check the
documentation for \ref TaskModelIntCard "details".

\section SecChange2Sorted Sortedness constraint

The sortedness constraint has been renamed to sorted.

\section Linking

Some generic functionality has been put into its own library (\code
libgecodesupport \endcode on Unix systems, \code GecodeSupport.dll \endcode on
Windows). You have to link against this library now.
