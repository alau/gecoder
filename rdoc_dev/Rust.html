  <section class="description">
    
<p><a href="Rust.html">Rust</a> is a Ruby bindings generator, developed by
Diego Pettenò &lt;flameeyes@gmail.com&gt;, based on a simpler Ruby
bindings generator that was used for RubyTag++ and ruby-hunspell.</p>

<p>The original bindings generator was designed to permit a 1:1 mapping
between C++ classes and Ruby classes, as otherwise writing Ruby bindings
for a C++-based library would have consisted of a long series of generic
functions to convert the types from one language to the other and to call
the methods.</p>

<p>Most C bindings, instead, either writes a lot of C code to create
“fake” Classes out of a vaguely object-oriented C API, or simply create
a module where to put all the C functions to call.</p>

<p>The objective of <a href="Rust.html">Rust</a> is to allow the description
of a C or C++ interface, through the creation of 1:1 class mappings or the
design of “fake” classes out of C functions, without the need to
actually write all the generic code, as that does not really change beside
names, types and parameters.</p>
