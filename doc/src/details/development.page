h1. Development

h2. Design goals

Gecode/R is designed to be readable, easy to learn and use without previous
knowledge of constraint programming. Some times that comes at the cost of 
brevity, performance and user control. The ambition is that code using the 
interface should be readable enough to allow a new user to understand it 
without having to look in the API documentation.

h2. Development status

The project has working releases and currently "supports many of 
the constraints available in Gecode":../features.html.

The set of constraints currently available is considered to be complete, and 
no further additions are likely until after version 1.0 has been released. 
The current focus is to add some finishing touches of sugar before
releasing version 1.0 .

h2. Future goals

h3. Scheduled for 1.0

* Add sugar to make all the composite constraints behave like variables
  of the corresponding type. This would e.g. allow placing constraints
  such as @(enum1.size + enum2.size).must > 17@, removing the need for
  defining additional variables.
* Add sugar for easily creating models with variables that are
  accessible from outside the model.

h3. Beyond 1.0

* Add support for defining custom propagators and branching selection.
  This should primarily be aimed at rapid prototyping since the performance 
  will be much worse than if the e.g. propagator was implemented in C++.
