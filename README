== Gecode/R

Gecode/R is a Ruby interface to Gecode, an open, free and efficient environment 
for developing constraint-based systems and applications.

== Installation

Gecode/R requires Gecode 1.3.1, which can be downloaded from 
http://www.gecode.org/download.html . See 
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageComp.html for the installation
instructions.

At this point no prebuilt gem is provided and has to be built from source. 
Check out the source code from svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/gecoder/trunk, enter
the root of the source and then do the following to build the gem and install 
it:
  
  rake gem
  gem install pkg/gecoder-0.x.gem
