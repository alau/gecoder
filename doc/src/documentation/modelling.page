Modelling is the process of creating a model for the problem, describing the 
constraints and variables involved. At some point a decent tutorial on the 
subject will be located here. For now this page just contains a link to "a 
paper on the 
subject":http://www.math.unipd.it/~frossi/cp-school/new-barbara-tutorial.pdf 
from the "Constraint Programming summer 
school":http://www.math.unipd.it/~frossi/cp-school/. It's a bit more in depth
than required.
