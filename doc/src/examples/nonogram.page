h1. Nonogram (Paint by Numbers)

h2. Problem

bq. Nonograms or Paint by Numbers are picture logic puzzles in which
cells in a grid have to be colored or left blank according to numbers
given at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle
type, the numbers measure how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares
there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3"
would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in
that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups. -
