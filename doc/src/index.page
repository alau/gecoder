description: A Ruby interface to Gecode, an open source environment for constraint programming.

h2. Overview

Gecode/R is a Ruby interface to "Gecode":http://www.gecode.org/, allowing 
constraint programming in Ruby. The interface is intended for people with no 
previous experience of constraint programming, aiming to be easy to pick up and 
use in practice.

h2. Constraint programming

Constraint programming is a declarative programming paradigm, you describe what 
kind of solution you want rather than how you want it computed. When using 
constraint programming you try to model the problem and then feed that model to 
the solver. The solver then searches for a solution by exploring the space of 
all possible solutions while using the constraints in the model to prune parts 
without having to visit them.

A popular example would be Soduko, to solve a Soduko with constraint 
programming you feed the rules (all numbers in each row must be distinct etc) 
to the solver, which then searches for a solution satisfying all the 
constraints. 

h2. Development status

The project is currently in an early development stage. The direction of the 
syntax/API has been set and the basic functionality is currently being 
implemented. A version with a very limited amount of functionality (but still 
able to solve some problems) should be available in a matter of weeks.

h2. Communication

The primary channel of communication at this point is the "gecoder-devel 
mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/gecoder-devel.
