h1. Survo Puzzle

h2. Problem

bq. Survo puzzle is a kind of logic puzzle presented (in April 2006) and
studied by Seppo Mustonen. The name of the puzzle is associated to
Mustonen's Survo system which is a general environment for statistical
computing and related areas.

bq. In a Survo puzzle the task is to fill an m * n table by integers
1,2,...,m*n so that each of these numbers appears only once and their
row and column sums are equal to integers given on the bottom and the
right side of the table.  Often some of the integers are given readily
in the table in order to guarantee uniqueness of the solution and/or for
making the task easier. -
