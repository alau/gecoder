== Gecode/R

Gecode/R is a Ruby interface to Gecode, an open, free and efficient environment 
for developing constraint-based systems and applications.

== Warning

Gecode/R is still in an early development stage, the syntax is by no means 
final and backwards compatibility will be broken time and time again until 
later in the development process. Don’t use Gecode/R in production-code yet, 
it’s merely available this early to allow people to play with it and give 
feedback.

== Installation

Gecode/R requires Gecode 1.3.1, which can be downloaded from 
http://www.gecode.org/download.html . See 
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageComp.html for the installation
instructions.

=== Installing from gem

  gem install gecoder

=== Installing from source using gem

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/gecoder-0.x.x.gem

=== Installing from source without using gem

"gecode.so" might have another extension depending on which platform it's 
generated on (replace the extension in the following commands with whatever 
extension it's given).

	cd ext
  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  mv gecode.so ../lib/

== Running the tests

  rake specs

Requires RSpec (1.0.5, but other version should hopefully work).
