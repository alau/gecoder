description: How to install Gecode/R to gain access to constraint programming in Ruby.

h2. Warning

Gecode/R is still under early development, the syntax is by no means final and
*backwards compatibility will be broken* time and time again until later in the
development process. Don't use Gecode/R in production-code yet, it's merely 
available this early to allow people to play with it and give feedback.

h2. Dependencies

Gecode/R requires Gecode 1.3.1, so you have to install that first.
* "Download link":http://www.gecode.org/download.html
* "Installation instructions":http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageComp.html

h2. Install

There are several different ways to install Gecode/R.

h3. RubyGems

This is probably the most convenient way.

 gem install gecoder
 
h3. Direct download

Downloads are available at "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3553

h3. Subversion

Check it out with

 svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/gecoder/trunk gecoder

then build and install the gem with

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/gecoder-0.x.gem
