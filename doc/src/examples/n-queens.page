h2. N-queens

h3. Definition

bq. The eight queens puzzle is the problem of putting eight chess queens on an 
8x8 chessboard such that none of them is able to capture any other using the 
standard chess queen's moves. - "Wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nqueens 

Replacing "8" with "n" we get the n-queens puzzle.

{includeFile: {filename: ../../../example/queens.rb, escapeHTML: false, processOutput: false, highlight: ruby}}
