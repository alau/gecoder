h1. Frequently Asked Questions

h2. What is Constraint Programming?

Constraint programming is a declarative programming paradigm, you describe what 
kind of solution you want rather than how you want it computed. When using 
constraint programming you model the problem and then feed that model to the 
solver. The solver then searches for a solution by exploring the space of all 
possible assignments while using the constraints in the model to prune parts 
without having to visit them.

A popular example is sudoku, to {example: {name: sudoku, 
linkText: solve a sudoku with constraint programming}}  you feed the rules (all 
numbers in each row must be distinct etc) to the solver, which then searches 
for a solution satisfying all the constraints.

h2. What Types of Problems are Suitable?

The ideal problems to use constraint programming on are problems that are easy
to describe but where the best one can do to solve them is an exhaustive search.
Typically NP-hard combinatorial problems.

If there exists an algorithm with polynomial time complexity for the problem 
then it will have a better worst case complexity. If the algorithm is hard to 
implement and/or complexity is not that important then constraint programming 
might still be worth testing/considering.

h2. Won't it be Slow?

It will always have exponential worst case complexity. However, if the model
is good, it can empirically scale better.

The reason is that Gecode is smart when it comes to pruning the search space 
and will often not have to visit most of it due to taking advantage of the 
placed constraints.
