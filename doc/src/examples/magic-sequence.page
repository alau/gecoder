h2. Problem

bq. A magic sequence of length n is a sequence of integers x0 . . xn-1 between 
0 and n-1, such that for all i in 0 to n-1, the number i occurs exactly xi 
times in the sequence. For instance, 6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0 is a magic sequence 
since 0 occurs 6 times in it, 1 occurs twice, ... -

h2. Notes

This might be a bit boring problem to use constraint programming on as the 
pattern for sequences is obvious for n >= 7, making it trivial to construct an
efficient algorithm.
