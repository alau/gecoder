Changes to be made for 1.1.0:

* Propkind is now only supported for extensional constraints.
* LinExpr etc are now in the Gecode namespace
* Set branchings MIN_CARD and MAX_CARD have been renamed
    * SET_VAR_MIN_CARD -> SET_VAR_SIZE_MIN
    * SET_VAR_MAX_CARD -> SET_VAR_SIZE_MAX
    * SET_VAR_MIN_UNKNOWN_ELEM -> SET_VAR_MIN_MIN
    * SET_VAR_MAX_UNKNOWN_ELEM -> SET_VAR_MAX_MAX
    * SET_VAL_MIN -> SET_VAL_MIN_INC
    * SET_VAL_MAX -> SET_VAL_MAX_INC
* Random has been added to all branchings
* A bunch of var and val branchings have been added to sets.
* The values provided through search statistics have changed.
* IMP and XOR have been removed from boolean expressions
* LinRel post now has a flag for posting negated constraints
* convexHull -> convex
* match -> channel, and has been made stronger? Does not just say that
  the elements must be contained, but also that they must be the only
  elements in the set.
* Set elements constraints have been merged into one function
