h1. Constraint Programming in Ruby

<div class="summary">
<p>Gecode/R is a Ruby interface to "Gecode":http://www.gecode.org/, an open 
source library for constraint programming. The interface is intended for people 
with no previous experience of constraint programming, aiming to be easy to 
pick up and use in practice.</p>
</div>

h2. Describe Your Problem

Constraint programming is _declarative_. Describe your problem to the
solver and then let it find solutions for you. 

h3. Example

Solve the equation system @x + y = z@, @x = y - 3@, @0 <= x,y,z <= 9@.

<ruby>
solution = Gecode.solve do
  # Set up the variables, three integers with domain 0..9.
  variables_is_an int_var_array(3, 0..9) 
  x,y,z = variables

  # Describe the problem (in this case the equations).
  (x + y).must == z 
  x.must == y - 3

  # Tell it what the variables of the problem are.
  branch_on variables
end

puts 'x y z'
puts solution.variables.values.join(' ')
</ruby>

Output:

<pre>
x y z
0 3 3
</pre>

Constraint programming is an easy way to solve problems that are simpler to 
describe than to solve. {example: {name: sudoku, 
linkText: Sudoku}} is one of many "examples":examples/index.html.
