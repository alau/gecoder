h2. Boolean constraints

Boolean constraints are used to place constraints on boolean variables. The 
following are some example, b1, b2 and b3 are all boolean variables.

<ruby>
b1.must_be.true # Constrains b1 to be true.
b2.must_be.false # Constraint b2 to be false.
</ruby>

Disjunction (or) can is expressed with @|@ and conjunction (and) is expressed 
with @&@.

<ruby>
(b1 | b2).must == b1 # Constraint the disjunction of b1 and b2 to equal b1.
(b1 & b3).must_be.true # Constrains the conjunction of b1 and b3 to be true.
</ruby>

Variations of @must@ can be replaced with variations of @must_not@ to negate the
constraints. Nested expressions can be used on both sides.

<ruby>
((b1 & b1) | b3).must_not == ((b1 | b3) & b2)
</ruby>
