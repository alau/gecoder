== Gecode/R

Gecode/R is a Ruby interface to Gecode, an open, free and efficient environment 
for developing constraint-based systems and applications.

== Warning

Gecode/R is still in an early development stage, the syntax is by no means 
final and backwards compatibility will be broken time and time again until 
later in the development process. Don’t use Gecode/R in production-code yet, 
it’s merely available this early to allow people to play with it and give 
feedback.

== Installation

Gecode/R requires Gecode 1.3.1, which can be downloaded from 
http://www.gecode.org/download.html . See 
http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageComp.html for the installation
instructions.
