h1. Contribute

<div class="summary">
<p>Anyone can contribute to Gecode/R by for instance pointing out flaws in the 
documentation, requesting features, giving feedback, sending patches, reporting
bugs and being active on the mailing lists.</p>
</div>

h2. Interact

Tell us what you think of Gecode/R. Tell us what could be better, what should
be changed, what is hard to understand. We want to know so that we can fix it.

Use "gecoder-users":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/gecoder-users for such
feedback (just send a mail there if you want to, there's no need to sign up). 
Subscribe to that mailing list and be helpful to contribute even more.

h2. Report bugs

Report bugs to "the bug 
tracker":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=13720&group_id=3553&func=browse.
Make sure that you include enough information for others to be able to reproduce
the bug.

h2. Submit patches

Send your patches to "the patch 
tracker":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=13722&group_id=3553&func=browse, 
preferably as diffs against the current trunk. If you make a habit of sending
good patches then we will just save us the hassle and give you direct commit 
access.

h2. Add feature requests

If you have an idea for a feature, but can't implement it yourself, then send
it to "the feature request 
tracker":http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=13723&group_id=3553&func=browse to
let someone else have a go at it.
