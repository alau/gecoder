h2. Overview

Gecode/R is a Ruby interface to "Gecode":http://www.gecode.org/, a library for
constraint programming. The interface is intended for people with no previous 
experience of constraint programming, aiming to be easy to pick up and use in 
practice.

h2. Constraint programming

Constraint programming is a declarative programming paradigm, you describe what 
kind of solution you want rather than how you want it computed. When using 
constraint programming you try to model the problem and then feed that model to 
the solver. The solver then searches for a solution by exploring the space of 
all possible assignments while using the constraints in the model to prune 
parts without having to visit them.

A popular example would be sudoku, to "solve a sudoku with constraint 
programming":examples/sudoku.html  you feed the rules (all numbers in each row 
must be distinct etc) to the solver, which then searches for a solution 
satisfying all the constraints.

h2. Development status

The project is currently in development and should support the "initial round 
of planned features":http://gecoder.rubyforge.org/features.html within a few 
weeks.

h2. Communication

Please use the 
"gecode-users mailing list":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/gecoder-users 
for usage questions and general discussion and 
"gecoder-devel":http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/gecoder-devel for 
development discussion.
