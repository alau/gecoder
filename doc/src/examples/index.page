h2. Overview

The following are the examples located in the example directory. 

<dl>
  <dt>"send+more=money":send-more-money.html</dt><dd>The "Hello world" of constraint programming. Shows the basic usage with some linear and distinct constraints.</dd>
  <dt>"send+most=money":send-most-money.html</dt><dd>Similar to the above, but also shows an example of optimization search.</dd>
  <dt>"Sudoku":sudoku.html</dt><dd>The popular puzzle solved using constraint programming. Shows how to use matrices and set propagation strengths.</dd>
  <dt>"Sudoku with sets":sudoku-set.html</dt><dd>The sudoku puzzle again, but this time using sets and a different viewpoint. Shows how to use set operations.</dd>
  <dt>"N-queens":n-queens.html</dt><dd>Shows how to use distinct with offsets.</dd>
  <dt>"Magic sequence":magic-sequence.html</dt><dd>Uses the count constraint and some implied constraints.</dd>
</dl>

Note that

<ruby>require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/example_helper'</ruby>

should be replaced with 

<ruby>
require 'rubygems'
require 'gecoder'
</ruby>

when running them from another location.
