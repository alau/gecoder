h1. Sudoku with sets

h2. Problem

bq. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid so that each column, each row, and each 
of the nine 3x3 boxes contains the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter 
provides a partially completed grid. - "Wikipedia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soduko

h2. Code

{includeFile: {filename: ../../../example/sudoku-set.rb, escapeHTML: false, processOutput: false, highlight: ruby}}

h2. Output

<pre>
3 7 8 2 6 5 9 1 4
5 9 6 8 1 4 7 3 2
1 4 2 7 3 9 5 6 8
2 1 7 3 8 6 4 5 9
8 5 4 9 7 1 6 2 3
6 3 9 5 4 2 8 7 1
7 8 5 4 2 3 1 9 6
4 6 3 1 9 7 2 8 5
9 2 1 6 5 8 3 4 7
</pre>

h3. Notes

We use a somewhat different viewpoint than when "using integer variables to 
solve sudokus":sudoku.html. Here we view the problem as a number of values that 
have to be assigned squares rather than as a number of squares that have to be 
assigned values. This is an example of two viewpoints can be linked using "the 
channel constraint":../documentation/set-constraints.html.
