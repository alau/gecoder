h1. Development

h2. Design goals

Gecode/R is designed to be readable, easy to learn and use without previous
knowledge of constraint programming. Some times that comes at the cost of 
brevity, performance and user control. The ambition is that code using the 
interface should be readable enough to allow a new user to understand it 
without referencing the API.

h2. Development status

The project has working releases and currently "supports many of 
the constraints available in Gecode":../features.html.

The current focus is on improving documentation before planning which features 
to add next.

h2. Future goals

There are still some Gecode features left to implement, and ideas for other
things that could be added. "A post on 
gecoder-devel":http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/gecoder-devel/2007-August/000031.html
might give some insight into what is next.
