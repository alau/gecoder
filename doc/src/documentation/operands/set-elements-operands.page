h1. Set Elements Operands

<div class="summary">
<p>The set elements operand is a relatively uncommon type of
operand created by using the @#elements@ property of set operands. It is used 
to place constraints on all elements of a set.</p></div>

h4. Examples of Set Elements Operands

All set elements operands are created by using {RDoc: SetOperand#elements} 
property.

<ruby>
# Creates a set elements operand from set_operand.
set_elements_operand = set_operand.elements
</ruby>

h2. Constraints

Generated from {RDoc: SetElementsConstraintReceiver}.
