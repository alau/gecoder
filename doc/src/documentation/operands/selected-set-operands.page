h1. Selected Set Operands

<div class="summary">
<p>The set elements operand is a relatively uncommon type of
operand created by using array access (the @#[]@ property) on set enumeration 
operands with a set operand as index. The operand represents all sets
with indices present in the set operand index.</p></div>

h4. Examples of Selected Set Operands

All selected set operands are created by using {RDoc: SetEnumOperand#[]} 
property.

<ruby>
# Creates a selected set operand from set_enum_operand and set_operand.
selected_set_operand = set_enum_operand[set_operand]
</ruby>
