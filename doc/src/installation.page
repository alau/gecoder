h2. Warning

Gecode/R is still in a development stage, the syntax is by no means final
and *backwards compatibility will be broken* time and time again. Don't use 
Gecode/R in production-code yet, it's merely available at this point to allow 
people to play with it and give feedback.

h2. Dependencies

Gecode/R requires Gecode 1.3.1, so you have to install that first.
* "Download link":http://www.gecode.org/download.html
* "Installation instructions":http://www.gecode.org/gecode-doc-latest/PageComp.html

h2. Installation

There are several different ways to install Gecode/R.

h3. RubyGems

This is probably the most convenient way.

 gem install gecoder
 
h3. Direct download

Downloads are available at "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3553

h3. Subversion

Check it out with

 svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/gecoder/trunk gecoder

h3. From source

h4. Using gem

Build and install the gem from source with

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/gecoder-0.x.x.gem

h4. Without using gem

"gecode.so" might have another extension depending on which platform it's 
generated on (replace the extension in the following commands with whatever 
extension it's given).

	cd ext
  ruby extconf.rb
  make
  mv gecode.so ../lib/

h2. Running the tests

To make sure that the installation was successful you can run the included 
specs. They require "RSpec":http://rspec.rubyforge.org/download.html 1.0.5 or
something similar. Run the specs by issuing the following command from the 
directory where Gecode/R was installed.

  rake specs
